**HextaUI isn't just another UI component library**

HextaUI is a complete design system that gives you everything you need to build beautiful, modern websites with Next.js. Think of it as your design toolkit - it includes ready-to-use components, helpful utilities, and clear guidelines that make building user interfaces faster and easier.

What makes HextaUI special? Unlike other UI libraries that lock you into their way of doing things, HextaUI gives you complete freedom. You simply copy the components you need into your project and customize them however you want.

Here's why HextaUI takes a different approach than traditional UI libraries:

- **Smart Components**: Our components are modular and flexible, allowing you to mix and match them in countless ways.
- **You Own Your Code**: When you use HextaUI, the components become part of your project. No hidden dependencies or vendor lock-in.
- **Easy Customization**: Change colors, fonts, and styles with simple CSS variables. Our modular design makes it easy to customize everything while keeping functionality intact.
- **Clear Documentation**: We provide step-by-step guides, live examples, and code snippets to help you get started quickly.
